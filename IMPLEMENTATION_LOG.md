# Implementation Log

## Phase 1: Models Layer ✓

**Date**: Implemented
**Status**: Complete

### What Was Implemented

The Models Layer provides the database schema and ORM models using SQLAlchemy, supporting both SQLite (local development) and PostgreSQL (production).

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`app/database.py`** - Database connection and session management
   - Configurable DATABASE_URL (SQLite by default)
   - Session factory for dependency injection
   - Base class for all models

2. **`app/models/category.py`** - Category model
   - UUID primary key
   - Name and color fields
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
   - One-to-many relationship with tasks

3. **`app/models/block.py`** - Time block model
   - UUID primary key
   - Start/end time with validation (end > start)
   - Title, block_number, day_number
   - One-to-many relationship with tasks
   - Category-agnostic design

4. **`app/models/task.py`** - Task model
   - UUID primary key
   - Foreign keys to block and category
   - Title, description
   - Estimated vs actual minutes tracking
   - Completion status and timestamp
   - Position for ordering within blocks
   - Constraints: positive estimated_minutes, reasonable actual_minutes

5. **`app/models/__init__.py`** - Package initialization

6. **`init_db.py`** - Database initialization script

7. **`verify_models.py`** - Verification script to test models

8. **`requirements.txt`** - Updated with dependencies:
   - SQLAlchemy 2.0.23
   - psycopg2-binary 2.9.9 (for PostgreSQL)
   - python-dotenv 1.0.0

### Key Design Decisions

1. **UUID as String** - Using string UUIDs for compatibility with both SQLite and PostgreSQL
2. **Cascade Deletes** - Deleting a block deletes its tasks; deleting a category is restricted if tasks exist
3. **Timestamps** - Track creation and completion times for analytics
4. **Position Field** - Allows tasks to be reordered within blocks
5. **Validation** - Database-level constraints for data integrity

### MVP Support

The models support the core MVP requirements:

✓ **Recurring Tasks** - Tasks can be tracked with completion dates (completed_at)
✓ **Pomodoro Blocks** - Time blocks contain ordered tasks
✓ **Task Tracking** - Position field enables proper ordering
✓ **Completion Recording** - completed and completed_at fields

### How to Use

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create database tables
python init_db.py

# Verify models work
python verify_models.py
```

### Notes

- The `completed_at` field was added (not in original data model) to track when tasks are completed
- All foreign key relationships use proper cascade rules
- Models are database-agnostic and work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL

## Phase 2: Schemas Layer ✓

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Complete

### What Was Implemented

The Schemas Layer provides Pydantic models for data validation and serialization. These schemas act as the data transfer objects (DTOs) between the API and clients, ensuring all incoming and outgoing data is properly validated.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`app/schemas/category.py`** - Category validation schemas
   - `CategoryBase` - Common fields (name, color)
   - `CategoryCreate` - Schema for creating categories (POST)
   - `CategoryUpdate` - Schema for updating categories (PUT/PATCH, all fields optional)
   - `Category` - Complete schema for API responses (includes id, timestamps)
   - Hex color validation with regex pattern matching

2. **`app/schemas/block.py`** - Block validation schemas
   - `BlockBase` - Common fields (start_time, end_time, title, block_number, day_number)
   - `BlockCreate` - Schema for creating blocks (POST)
   - `BlockUpdate` - Schema for updating blocks (PUT/PATCH, all fields optional)
   - `Block` - Complete schema for API responses (includes id, created_at)
   - Time range validation (end_time must be after start_time)

3. **`app/schemas/task.py`** - Task validation schemas
   - `TaskBase` - Common fields (block_id, category_id, title, description, estimated_minutes, position)
   - `TaskCreate` - Schema for creating tasks (POST)
   - `TaskUpdate` - Schema for updating tasks (includes completed, actual_minutes, all fields optional)
   - `Task` - Complete schema for API responses (includes id, completed, completed_at, created_at)
   - Validation: positive estimated_minutes, reasonable actual_minutes (max 1 week)

4. **`app/schemas/__init__.py`** - Package initialization with imports
   - Exports all schemas for easy importing
   - Includes comprehensive documentation

5. **`verify_schemas.py`** - Comprehensive verification script
   - Tests all schemas with valid and invalid data
   - Demonstrates validation error handling
   - Shows how schemas work with API requests/responses

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Schema Hierarchy** - Base → Create → Update → Response pattern for each model
2. **Optional Updates** - Update schemas have all fields optional for partial updates
3. **Field Validation** - Pydantic validators for:
   - Hex color format (#RGB or #RRGGBB)
   - Time range validation (end > start)
   - Positive and reasonable time estimates
4. **from_attributes** - Enabled in Config for easy ORM → Pydantic conversion
5. **Extensive Comments** - Added detailed docstrings explaining each schema's purpose and usage

### Schema Validation Examples

```python
# Valid category creation
category = CategoryCreate(name="Deep Work", color="#1E90FF")

# Invalid color - raises ValueError
category = CategoryCreate(name="Test", color="blue")  # ✗

# Valid task with validation
task = TaskCreate(
    block_id="...",
    category_id="...",
    title="Study FastAPI",
    estimated_minutes=45
)

# Invalid - estimated_minutes must be positive
task = TaskCreate(..., estimated_minutes=0)  # ✗

# Valid time block
block = BlockCreate(
    start_time=datetime.now(),
    end_time=datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=2),
    title="Block 1"
)

# Invalid - end must be after start
block = BlockCreate(start_time=now, end_time=now - timedelta(hours=1))  # ✗
```

### MVP Support

The schemas support the core MVP requirements:

✓ **Type Safety** - All API data is validated before processing
✓ **Partial Updates** - Update schemas support changing individual fields
✓ **Error Messages** - Clear validation errors for debugging
✓ **API Documentation** - FastAPI auto-generates docs from schemas

### How to Use

```bash
# Verify schemas work correctly
python verify_schemas.py
```

In FastAPI routes (to be implemented in API Layer):
```python
from app.schemas import CategoryCreate, Category

@router.post("/categories", response_model=Category)
def create_category(category: CategoryCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # category is automatically validated against CategoryCreate
    # response is automatically validated against Category
    ...
```

### Next Steps

- [x] Implement Services Layer (business logic for recurring tasks)
- [ ] Implement API Layer (FastAPI endpoints with these schemas)
- [ ] Implement Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS with Bloomberg Terminal styling)

### Notes

- All validation rules match database constraints for consistency
- Color validation uses regex to ensure valid hex codes
- Time validation prevents logical errors (negative durations)
- Extensive inline comments for educational purposes

## Phase 3: Services Layer ✓

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Status**: Complete

### What Was Implemented

The Services Layer implements all business logic for the Night Shift MVP app, with special support for **recurring blocks**. Services act as an intermediary between API routes and database models, providing clean separation of concerns.

5. **`SERVICES_LAYER_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - Detailed guide for all services
   - Recurring blocks workflow explanation
   - Integration examples for API layer
   - Best practices and testing examples

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Recurring Blocks Architecture

**Requirement**: Blocks should be recurring (not tasks). When a block is completed, it should be repopulated and placed at the back of the queue.

**Solution**: Use existing data model without changes:
- `Block.block_number` controls queue ordering (lower = earlier)
- `complete_and_reset_block()` function:
  1. Marks all incomplete tasks as complete (records completion)
  2. Immediately resets all tasks to incomplete
  3. Moves block to end by giving it highest block_number + 1

**Example Workflow**:
```
Block #1: Morning Routine [complete] → Reset → Block #10: Morning Routine
Block #2: Deep Work [now active]
Block #3: Learning Block
```

#### 2. No Model Changes Needed ✅

The existing models fully support recurring blocks:
- `Task.completed` can toggle between true/false
- `Task.completed_at` records completion timestamp
- `Block.block_number` enables queue management
- All relationships work as-is

#### 3. Service Layer Responsibilities

Services handle:
- Business logic (recurring blocks, completion tracking)
- Validation (verify block/category exists before creating task)
- Complex operations (bulk operations, statistics)
- Database transactions (commit/rollback)

API routes should:
- Handle HTTP requests/responses
- Call service functions
- Return appropriate status codes
- NOT directly access the database

#### 4. Progress Tracking

Multiple levels of progress tracking:
- **Task level**: Individual completion status
- **Block level**: Percentage of tasks complete
- **Category level**: Completion rate across all tasks
- **System level**: Overall statistics

### MVP Support

The services support all core MVP requirements:

✅ **Recurring Blocks** - Complete, reset, and reorder blocks  
✅ **Queue Management** - Blocks ordered by `block_number`  
✅ **Task Tracking** - Full CRUD with position management  
✅ **Progress Statistics** - Completion tracking at all levels  
✅ **Bulk Operations** - Efficient multi-task operations  
✅ **Block Cloning** - Create copies for true recurrence  

### Usage Examples

#### Create and Complete a Recurring Block

```python
from app.services import block_service, task_service
from app.schemas import BlockCreate, TaskCreate

# Create block
block = block_service.create_block(db, BlockCreate(
    start_time=datetime.now(),
    end_time=datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=2),
    title="Morning Routine",
    block_number=1
))

# Add tasks
task1 = task_service.create_task(db, TaskCreate(
    block_id=block.id,
    category_id="category-id",
    title="Meditation",
    estimated_minutes=20
))

task2 = task_service.create_task(db, TaskCreate(
    block_id=block.id,
    category_id="category-id",
    title="Exercise",
    estimated_minutes=30
))

# Complete all tasks and reset block
result = block_service.complete_and_reset_block(db, block.id, move_to_end=True)
# {
#   "tasks_completed": 2,
#   "tasks_reset": 2,
#   "new_block_number": 10,
#   "moved_to_end": True
# }

# Block is now ready to be done again!
```

#### Get Next Block in Queue

```python
next_block_info = block_service.get_next_block(db)
# {
#   "block": Block(...),
#   "total_tasks": 3,
#   "completed_tasks": 1,
#   "completion_percentage": 33.33
# }
```

#### Clone a Block

```python
# Create a recurring "template" block and clone it
template_block = block_service.create_block(db, ...)
# Add tasks to template...

# Clone for tomorrow
tomorrow = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
new_block = block_service.clone_block(
    db,
    template_block.id,
    new_start_time=tomorrow,
    copy_tasks=True  # Copy all tasks
)
```

### How to Use

Services are ready to be used in the API layer:

```python
# In your FastAPI routes:
from app.services import block_service, task_service, category_service
from app.database import get_db

@router.post("/blocks/{block_id}/complete-and-reset")
def complete_and_reset(block_id: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    result = block_service.complete_and_reset_block(db, block_id)
    if not result:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Block not found")
    return result

@router.get("/blocks/next")
def get_next(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return block_service.get_next_block(db)
```

### Testing the Services

You can test services directly:

```python
# Example: Test in Python REPL or Jupyter notebook
from app.database import SessionLocal
from app.services import category_service
from app.schemas import CategoryCreate

db = SessionLocal()

# Create category
cat = category_service.create_category(db, CategoryCreate(
    name="Test Category",
    color="#FF5733"
))

# Get stats
stats = category_service.get_category_stats(db, cat.id)
print(stats)

db.close()
```

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: API ↔ Services ↔ Models
2. **Reusable**: Services can be used by API, CLI, scripts, tests
3. **Testable**: Easy to unit test without HTTP layer
4. **Maintainable**: Business logic in one place
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new functions

### Next Steps

- [x] Services Layer complete with recurring blocks
- [ ] Implement API Layer (FastAPI routes using these services)
- [ ] Implement Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS with Bloomberg Terminal styling)
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for all services
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization if needed

### Notes

- **No database model changes required** - existing schema fully supports recurring blocks
- All services include comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Services handle `None` returns for not-found scenarios
- Transaction management handled within services (commit/rollback)
- Extensive documentation in `SERVICES_LAYER_GUIDE.md`
