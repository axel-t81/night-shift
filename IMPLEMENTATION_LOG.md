# Implementation Log

## Phase 1: Models Layer ✓

**Date**: Implemented
**Status**: Complete

### What Was Implemented

The Models Layer provides the database schema and ORM models using SQLAlchemy, supporting both SQLite (local development) and PostgreSQL (production).

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`app/database.py`** - Database connection and session management
   - Configurable DATABASE_URL (SQLite by default)
   - Session factory for dependency injection
   - Base class for all models

2. **`app/models/category.py`** - Category model
   - UUID primary key
   - Name and color fields
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
   - One-to-many relationship with tasks

3. **`app/models/block.py`** - Time block model
   - UUID primary key
   - Start/end time with validation (end > start)
   - Title, block_number, day_number
   - One-to-many relationship with tasks
   - Category-agnostic design

4. **`app/models/task.py`** - Task model
   - UUID primary key
   - Foreign keys to block and category
   - Title, description
   - Estimated vs actual minutes tracking
   - Completion status and timestamp
   - Position for ordering within blocks
   - Constraints: positive estimated_minutes, reasonable actual_minutes

5. **`app/models/__init__.py`** - Package initialization

6. **`init_db.py`** - Database initialization script

7. **`verify_models.py`** - Verification script to test models

8. **`requirements.txt`** - Updated with dependencies:
   - SQLAlchemy 2.0.23
   - psycopg2-binary 2.9.9 (for PostgreSQL)
   - python-dotenv 1.0.0

### Key Design Decisions

1. **UUID as String** - Using string UUIDs for compatibility with both SQLite and PostgreSQL
2. **Cascade Deletes** - Deleting a block deletes its tasks; deleting a category is restricted if tasks exist
3. **Timestamps** - Track creation and completion times for analytics
4. **Position Field** - Allows tasks to be reordered within blocks
5. **Validation** - Database-level constraints for data integrity

### MVP Support

The models support the core MVP requirements:

✓ **Recurring Tasks** - Tasks can be tracked with completion dates (completed_at)
✓ **Pomodoro Blocks** - Time blocks contain ordered tasks
✓ **Task Tracking** - Position field enables proper ordering
✓ **Completion Recording** - completed and completed_at fields

### How to Use

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create database tables
python init_db.py

# Verify models work
python verify_models.py
```

### Next Steps

- [ ] Implement Schemas Layer (Pydantic models)
- [ ] Implement Services Layer (business logic for recurring tasks)
- [ ] Implement API Layer (FastAPI endpoints)
- [ ] Implement Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS with Bloomberg Terminal styling)

### Notes

- The `completed_at` field was added (not in original data model) to track when tasks are completed
- All foreign key relationships use proper cascade rules
- Models are database-agnostic and work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL
